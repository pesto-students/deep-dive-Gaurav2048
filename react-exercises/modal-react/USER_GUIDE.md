## Introduction

Idea is to build reusable react modal component which should be accessible according to the modern web accessibility practices.

To give overview of react-modal , we have bundled Demo App.

# How to run DemoApp

 1. Go to modal-react directory under react-excercises folder
 2. Run `npm i`
 2. Run `npm run start` 


#  You can pass below props with Modal    
                                         
 - onModalClosed={props.onModalClosed}                required
 - title                                'Modal'       optional
 - borderRadius                         0px           optional
 - backgroundColor                      #fff          optional
 - titleColor                           #000          optional
 - titleSize                            16px          optional
